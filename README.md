BiT Slack Bot Project

The Blacks-In-Technology (BiT) group is working on a SlackBot project! Let's get
some minds together and add some functionality to the [Blacks-In-Technology Slack](http://blacksintechnology.slack.com)
rooms.

## Status

Right now we're at the very beginning of the project, where platform decisions and
requirements are beign hammered out. We've discussed using [Given-When-Then](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given-When-Then) to describe desired features and [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the development language.
